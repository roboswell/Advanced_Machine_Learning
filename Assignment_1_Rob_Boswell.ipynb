I further tuned for max_iter between the range of 500 and 5000, in increments of 200.

While the most important features for the XGBoost model (further below) seem primarily focused on resources necessary for survival, instead the ElasticNet model's best features appear geared towards one's social well-being, with perhaps the one exception being \"Violent Crime\". Still, violent crime does impact emotional well-being, which is likely tied to social-wellbeing."

    "The scatterplot shows a fairly distinct trend, whereby as countries have more material resources, their populations' level of happiness tends to increase. There are some outliers in all 5 cateogories of level of happiness, but it appears that as you increase level of happiness there are fewer outliers of countries' amounts of material resources. E.g., in the very low category of happiness, while most countries' material resources appear to cluster between 0 and 50 - there are 5 noticeable outliers betwen 60 and 90. However, for the very high category of level of happiness, most countries cluster around having between a material resources score of about 80 to 100, with 3 outliers between 50 to 80. This trend in numbers outliers of material resources outliers narrowing as levels of happiness increase may also be a result of the fact that there are more countries which have very low levels of happiness than countries which have very high levels of happiness.

    "The scatterplot showing countries' strength of rule of law scores compared to their levels of happiness, while having a slightly less clear trend, does show that in general as countries' strength of rule of law scores increase, the countries' level of happiness also increases. Countries having a very low level of happiness have rule of law scores that cluster mostly between 20 and about 48, while countries having very high levels of happiness cluser around rule of law scores between 60 and 90. There seems to be a lot more variation in strength of rule of law among countries that are in the high level of happiness category than any of the other levels of happiness categories. It is also interesting that there are 3 country outliers that have a very high level of happiness yet have rule of law scores below 40."

    "We see a moderately distinct trend whereby as level of physical health increase, level of happiness also increases. With regards to level of physical health, we again see a very noticeable trend of having fewer outliers from primary clusters of countries the higher the level of happiness of those countries. It is somewhat interesting that countries having a very low level of happiness have a primary cluster of countries between about 48 and 68, whereas in the low level of happiness category, the primary clusters go as low as about 42. It is also interesting that it appears that the 3 countries having the highest scores for level of physical health are all located in the high category for level of happiness rather than the very high category."

    "Unlike the other models, I manually tuned the NN model. Initially, I started with 3 hidden layers, each with 64 neurons, with a kernal_regularizer and bias_regularizer for each hidden layer, all set to l1_l2(0.3) regularization. I also started (and ended) with EarlyStopping and ModelCheckoint. Initially, I set EarlyStopping at 200 epochs (without decreases in loss), but I eventually experimented with increasing early stopping, ending up at 400 epochs, as I noticed that overfitting might occur with some of the epochs near the end, but that ModelCheckpoint would save my highest cross-validated accuracy score. This meant that the model obtained through ModelCheckpoint would not suffer from overfitting. With this in mind, I increased my original total number of epochs from 500 to 1000 to allow for added potential to obtain a higher cross-validated accuracy score than I likely would have achieved had I kept my epochs at 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradually, I began addding additional parameters, including BatchNormalization() and Dropout() to each hidden layer. Initially, Dropout was set to 0.3 for each hidden layer. I wasn't getting the accuracy I hoped for, and so I began to decrease it, ending with a noticeable increase in accuracy as I reached 0.1. My initial batch size was 50, but I experimented by increasing gradually, then decreasing it, and finally found a batch_size of 32 to seem to increase maximize the accuracy I was getting. Ultimately, I ended up with an accuracy score of 0.692308, an f1_score of 0.670553, precision of 0.673893, and recall of 0.688333.  "
